//‚≠êfunctions
// It is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. And it can be reused .
// Functions are also called as methods, procedures, sub-routines etc in some programming languages.
// before using a function we have to define a function(function definition).
// A function definition is also called function declartion or function statement.
    //üëâfunction definition
    //   function functionName(){
    //       code to be executed.
    //   }

//üëâPARAMETERS and ARGUMENTs 
// function sum(a,b){ /**the variables in a function which collect the value from a function call are called formal arguments
//                      or Parameters. */
//    return a+b; 
// }
// sum(5,19);         /***The values which are passed in a function are called actual arguments or arguments. */

//üëâAnonymous functions: functions with no function name.
//these functions are declared and stored inside a variable.
// example:
// var sum = function(a,b){
// return a+b;
// }
// console.log(sum(2,3));  /*Anonymous functions are called by the variable name in which they are stored. */
